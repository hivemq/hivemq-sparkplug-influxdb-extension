== Sparklpug Extension for HiveMQ

image::/img/HiveMQSparkplugExtension.jpg[Sunset]

*Extension Type:* Monitoring of IIoT data

*Version:* 4.5.3

*License:* Apache License 2.0

=== Purpose

The HiveMQ {sparkplug-link}[Sparkplug^] Extension can be leveraged to gather sparkplug metrics from {hivemq-link}[HiveMQ^] and persist them into a {influxdb-link}[InfluxDB^] database.
This database can be used as the data source for a monitoring dashboard to monitor directly the data from the devices and gateways of a Sparkplug Infrastructure.

=== Installation
Installing the extension for HiveMQ is very easy:

. Unzip the downloaded zip file
. In the folder `hivemq-sparkplug-extension`, modify the `sparkplug.properties` file to fit your needs. Check that the mandatory properties fro influx db (host, port) are set
. Copy the folder `hivemq-sparkplug-extension` to your `[HIVEMQ_HOME]/extensions` folder
. Done


=== Configuration
The Sparkplug Monitoring extension uses its own configuration file `sparkplug.properties`. The extension won't start if this file is missing or the required properties are not set.

==== General Configuration

|===
| Config name | Required | Description | Default

| influxdb.mode | no | The mode configured for the InfluxDB sender. Possibilities are: http, tcp, udp, cloud | http
| influxdb.host | yes | The host name of the InfluxDB instance. | -
| influxdb.port | yes | The port number the InfluxDB instance is listening. | 8086
| influxdb.protocol | no | The protocol the InfluxDB sender uses in http mode. | http
| influxdb.auth | no | The authorization string to be used to connect to InfluxDB, of format username:password. If mode "cloud" is used, the token must be passed here| -
| influxdb.prefix | no | The measurement prefix. | -
| influxdb.database | no | The database name. | hivemq
| influxdb.reportingInterval | no | The reporting interval in seconds. | 1
| influxdb.connectTimeout | no | The connect and read timeout in seconds. | 5000
| influxdb.tags | no | The tags for each metric. Listed as a semicolon ( `;` ) separated list. | -
| influxdb.organization | only for mode: "cloud" | The organization to push data to | -
| influxdb.bucket | only for mode: "cloud" | The bucket to push data to | -
| sparkplug.version | no | The sparkplug version to be used | spBv1.0

=== First Steps

==== Quick Start Sparkplug

===== InfluxDB setup
If you don't already have an InfluxDB 2.0 instance set up, here is a instruction how to start a not configured InfluxDB instance with Docker.

. Download and install {docker}[Docker^] for your platform
. Start an InfluxDB docker container with the command `docker run -p 8086:8086 -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb`. For more information about using InfluxDB with Docker visit the {influxdb-docker}[official Docker repository^] for InfluxDB
. A local instance of InfluxDB should be running with the port for the database set to 8086
. The initial setup process for InfluxDB walks through creating a default organization, user, bucket, and Admin authentication token. The setup process is available in both the InfluxDB user interface (UI) and in the influx command line interface (CLI).
. UI Setup - With InfluxDB running, visit localhost:8086.
.. Click Get Started
.. Set up your initial user
.. Enter a Username for your initial user.
.. Enter a Password and Confirm Password for your user.
.. Enter your initial Organization Name.
.. Enter your initial Bucket Name.
.. Click Continue.
. Done

===== Sparkplug setup
The Extensions actual supports the Sparkplug B specification for payload.
The sparkplug schema is defined with protobuf.

==== Usage
After the extension is installed and an InfluxDB instance exists.
. Start HiveMQ
. Extension successfully started if configuration file exists and contains required properties

==== Example deployment
For testing purposes a simple HiveMQ docker file with the sparkplug extension and a compose file for influxDB setup is available in the
deploy/docker subfolder.
Further a Kubernetes script for deploying hivemq with sparkplug extension setup in Kuberntes is available in the deploy/k8s

==== Influx Dashboard
An influx dashboard example *SparkplugInfluxDB-Dashboard.json* is available in the deploy subfolder.
The dashboard contains diagrams to monitor the Sparkplug online status of edge nodes and devices.
It also gathered the sparkplug data values from the example devices.
